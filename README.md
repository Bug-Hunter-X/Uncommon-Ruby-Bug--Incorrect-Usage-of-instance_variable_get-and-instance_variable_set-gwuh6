This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Ruby related to the usage of instance_variable_get and instance_variable_set methods.  The bug arises from a subtle difference in how these methods handle symbols when accessing and modifying instance variables.

The `bug.rb` file showcases the problem. The `bugSolution.rb` file provides the corrected code.
